Assignment 2 IMAD 

 

Purpose 

  

The purpose of a Tamagotchi app is to simulate the experience of caring for a virtual pet, like to be the original Tamagotchi handheld digital pets. Users feed, play with, and take care of their virtual pet to keep it happy and healthy. It is an interactive way to experience the joy of pet ownership without real-world responsibilities. 

  

2.) Design Considerations  

  

(my Image View did not want to show my picture for the screenshot) 

  

General design 

  

Yes, my design does suit users because anyone can operate my application, it is even suitable for kids too. It is attractive for kids because all kids love animals and I used a dog that is cute, and everyone loves it, including kids too. The only colors I used were orange and yellow for my first page and second page whereby I changed the background color for each.  

  

Intuitive design 

  

My design is easy to follow because I set it up in a way that you see all the buttons clearly and have given you the set of instructions on how you can run my design as an app. From top to bottom its quite simple because everything is put up correctly and its evenly spaced out.  

  

Content prioritization 

  

Yes, I do include the necessary interface elements such as Val and Var but now in my Assignment 2 I have only used Val to declare all my variables for the assignment. Yes, I do display essential content and functionality for my design is quite the experience, but it is one of the best working apps I have ever created. 

  

Legible Text Content 

  

Yes, I do use a font that everybody can see clearly and the font that I used for my whole assignment 2 was Arial Nova. Yes, the text is big enough for you to see it clearly whereby all my words are over 14 in the font size.  

Make Interface Elements Clearly Visible  

Yes, the user can see all the components such as image views and buttons are there is my assignment 2. All my buttons and my Images are spaced up well and they are organized correctly in my assignment 2.  

  

Hand Position Controls 

  

Yes, the buttons are in a position where they are easily reachable without giving a lot of effort to try and operate my Tamagotchi App. I used 4 buttons, and they all work when clicked. 

  

Images 

  

I chose a Pitbull as my pet because they are animals that love playing, they might come across as dangerous, but they are friendly dogs with an adventurous mind when it comes to exercise for it.  

  

   

This is a picture of Polly eating. This picture will also appear on my second page when you click on the feed button.  

 

 

  

This is a picture of Polly getting cleaned up. This picture will also appear on my second page when you click on the clean button.  

  

This is a picture of Polly playing fetch. This will be the picture on the second page when you click the play button.  

 

  

 

This picture above will be on my first page (design). This will be the welcome picture for the App. The dog's name is Polly btw.
